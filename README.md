# Virtual Dom Example

[Demo](http://natrube.net/virtual-dom-example/index.html)

I had free time before vacation and I wanted spend it usefully.
I made very simple implementation React.js / Cycle.js virtual dom and change detection.
This is for fun :)

## In this example:
- Smart change detection (render only change element)
- React like event system
- Support attributes
- Not support components, only pure functions
